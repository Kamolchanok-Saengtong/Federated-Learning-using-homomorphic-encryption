This can be used for instance when there is no centralised dataset on the server for validation/test. Also, this method can be use to asses the degree of personalisation of the model being federated.\n",

    "\n",

    "A strategy sits at the core of the Federated Learning experiment. It is involved in all stages of a FL pipeline: sampling clients; sending the _global model_ to the clients so they can do `fit()`; receive the updated models from the clients and **aggregate** these to construct a new _global model_; define and execute global or federated evaluation; and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way `FedAvg` works is simple but performs surprisingly well in practice. It is therefore one good strategy to start your experimentation. `FedAvg`, as its name implies, derives a new version of the _global model_ by taking the average of all the models sent by clients participating in the round. You can read all the details [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Flower strategies offer a high degree of customization using callbacks, in this tutorial we'll focus on using just one: the `evaluate_metrics_aggregation_fn` callback. It allows you to pass a function that should be executed at the end of an _\"evaluate\"_ round (i.e. a round where clients evaluate the _global model_ they receive on their local data and report the result -- e.g. accuracy, loss, etc -- back to the server). For this tutorial we want to perform the weighted average of the _\"accuracy\"_ metrics returned by each `FlowerClient`'s `evaluate()` method:"

    "Flower strategies can be extended easily to suit your FL setups or your preferred workflows whether you use Flower for research or in production. In this final section, you'll learn how to create a custom strategy that behaves just like `FedAvg` but extends the functionality of certain methods to achieve two things:\n",

    "2. Create a plot at after the last round.\n",

Note this functionality is user-defined since it requires a choice in terms of ML-framework. (if you recall, Flower is framework agnostic).\n",
    "\n",
    "> This being said, centralised evaluation of the global model is only possible if there exists a centralised dataset that somewhat follows a similar distribution as the data that's spread across clients. In some cases having such centralised dataset for validation is not possible, so the only solution is to federate the evaluation of the _global model_. This is the default behaviour in Flower. If you don't specify the `evaluate_fn` argument in your strategy, then, centralised global evaluation won't be performed."
